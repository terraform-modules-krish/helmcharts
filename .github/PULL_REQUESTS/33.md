I think we should exclude these templates for this repo. This repo is only used for publishing the helm charts as they release in https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helm-kubernetes-services and both community issues and PRs make no sense. E.g., see the PRs we've opened in the past: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/helmcharts/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

In fact, in the future, we will probably automate that PR with CI from the `helm-kubernetes-services`, which would further make the templates moot.
